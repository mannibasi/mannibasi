## Hi, I'm Manni 👋

I am a **Software Engineering Leader** with 20 years of experience building and modernizing high-scale FinTech platforms. I balance a strong hands-on technical foundation with the ability to lead empowered, high-performing teams.

I am equally at home defining engineering strategy as I am architecting solutions or diving into the code. I am currently looking for my next challenge as a **Principal/Lead Engineer** or **Engineering Manager**.
